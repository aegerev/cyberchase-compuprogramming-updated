		<h1>Array Filter Task</h1>
        <p>The Hacker has mixed Odds and Evens into one lump sum! Nobody can figure out which number is odd and which is even! That is, the Cybersquad can help - and you, too! 
            <br/> <br/> 
            Click on the "Generate Random Numbers" button to generate a list of numbers. Try to come up with the answers on your own.
            <br/> <br/> 
            Once you're done, click on the "Filter Even Numbers" button to see the correct answer!

		<h1>Math Fact</h1>
        <p> The command "number % 2 === 0" is no joke - it tells you what an even number is! If the number is divisible by 2 (if the number, when divided by 2, yields a remainder of 0), then that number is considered to be even. If not, then the number is odd.
            <br/> <br/>
            An example is the number 10. 10 / 2 = 5, with a remainder of 0. Therefore, we can conclude that 10 is an even number.
