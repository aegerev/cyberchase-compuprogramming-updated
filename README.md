## The Cyberchase Activity Center
I'll admit it: Cyberchase is THE SHOW where kids can learn math. Even though it's produced by CRAP, the math content is... I don't know how to call it. 

Since I am a fan of PBS KIDS (yes, Y12 is the "New PBS KIDS"), I just had to do something to bring back the PBS KIDS of old. What better way than with a Cyberchase Math Activity site?

## Sections
There are a total of 3 sections:

* "Square the Numbers":
    * You are given a list of numbers. Your goal is to square those numbers.
    * Math Fact: Square Numbers.

* "Filter Odds and Evens":
    * You are given a list of numbers. Your goal is to filter the numbers into 2 categories: Odd and Even. 
    * Math Fact: Even and Odd Numbers. 

* "Sum of Arrays":
    * You are given a list of numbers. Your goal is to add the values of the array.
    * Math Fact: Arrays Sum-Up
 
Each and every activity contains directions for the activity + a "Math Fact" - a fact about the math topic mentioned in the activity. 

I just hope that someone from PBS KIDS would notice what I'm doing...!
